 Introduction
 There are a lot of car manufacturers in the US. With the development of manufacturing units and tests, there are a lot of cars being manufactured with a lot of features. Therefore, innovators are coming up with the latest developments in the field and they are ensuring that the drivers get the best experience going on a ride in these cars.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this section of the project, the data is explored to see the patterns and trends and observe interesting insights. Below are some interesting observations generated.

A large number of cars were from the manufacturer 'Chevrolet' followed by 'Ford'.
The total number of cars manufactured during the year 2015 was the highest in all the years found on the data.
There were many missing values for 'Market Category' feature and a few missing values for the features 'Engine HP' and 'Engine Cylinders'.
The average prices of the cars were the highest in the year 2014 and lowest in the year 1990 from the data.
The prices of 'Bugatti' manufacturer are extremely high compared to the other car manufacturers.
'Bugatti' manufacturer also had an extremely high value for horsepower (HP) based on the graphs in the notebook.
There is a negative correlation between the feature 'City Mileage' and other features such as 'Engine Cylinders' and 'Engine HP'. This is true because the higher the mileage of the car, there is higher the probability that the total number of cylinders and engine horsepower would be low.
